<h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
<p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.</p>
<h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>

<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>HTML pages are text documents.</p>
<p>HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.

<p>Tags are often referred to as elements.

<p>Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.

<p>Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element. 

<p>Attributes require a name and a value.

<p>To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
