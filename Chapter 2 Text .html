<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about
an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all
the other scientific journals her work had
appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On
The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book
since college, and the longer she spent in these
four walls the more she felt she needed to be
free.</p>
<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote
proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although
many considered her pioneering work, unraveling
the secrets of the llama <abbr
title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an
outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
she had something better to do.</p>
