# Summary
## Chapter 1: Structure
```
*HTML pages are text documents.

*HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.

*Tags are often referred to as elements.

*Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.

*Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element. 

*Attributes require a name and a value.

*To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

```
## Chapter 2: Text
```

*HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

*They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

```
## Chapter 3: Lists
```
*There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.

*Ordered lists use numbers.

*Unordered lists use bullets.

*Definition lists are used to define terminology.

*Lists can be nested inside one another.

```
## Chapter 4: Links
```
*Links are created using theX <a> element.

*The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.

*If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

*You can create links to open email programs with anX email address in the "to" field.

*You can use theX id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

```
## Chapter 5: Images
```
*TheX <img> element is used to add images to a web page.

*You must always specify aX src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.

*You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

*Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
